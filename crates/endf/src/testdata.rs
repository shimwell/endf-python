//! Reading the compressed fixtures, for the unit tests.
//!
//! The fixtures in `tests/` are stored xz-compressed: an evaluation is highly
//! repetitive and compresses about six to one, and the ACE table alone is
//! 1.8 MB uncompressed. They are embedded with `include_bytes!` as before and
//! decompressed on first use, so a test still needs no working directory.
//!
//! Compiled only for tests, so the decompressor is a dev-dependency and no
//! consumer of this crate pays for it.
