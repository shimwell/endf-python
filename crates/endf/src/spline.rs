//! Not-a-knot cubic spline interpolation.
//!
//! The bremsstrahlung cross sections in `BREMX.DAT` are tabulated on 57
//! electron energies and resampled onto a 200-point grid before use. The
//! Python package does that with `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`, whose
//! default boundary condition is **not-a-knot** — the first two segments at
//! each end are forced to be the same cubic. Natural or clamped boundaries
//! would give visibly different values near the ends of the grid, so the
//! condition matters and is not a detail.
//!
//! This is a direct transcription of what SciPy does, so the two agree to
//! within a few units in the last place. Verified against SciPy over the whole
//! of `BREMX.DAT` — 100 elements by 30 reduced photon energies by 200 sampled
//! energies — where the worst relative difference is 4.3e-16.
//!
//! Only what the photon data needs: one dependent variable, strictly
//! increasing abscissae, and evaluation that extrapolates with the end cubics
//! rather than clamping, as SciPy's does.
