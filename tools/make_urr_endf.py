"""Write a synthetic evaluation with unresolved resonance Cases A and B.

These are the two shapes issue #15 made unreachable. Both readers dispatched on
LRF where the format uses LRU, so a range with LRU=2 and LRF=1 matched neither
branch: its records were left on the stream, and the *next* range was then read
from the middle of it. Case C (LRU=2, LRF=2) worked only because the two flags
happen to coincide there.

No real evaluation small enough to keep here has Case A or Case B, so the
fixture is built:

* **Isotope 1, LFW=0** — a Case A range (all parameters energy-independent),
  followed by a resolved Breit-Wigner range. The second range is the point: if
  the first is skipped without consuming its records, the second is parsed from
  the wrong offset and comes back with LRU=0 and its EL/EH holding the first
  range's SPI and AP.
* **Isotope 2, LFW=1** — a Case B range, where only the fission widths are
  energy-dependent, so the parameters arrive one LIST per J value with the
  energy grid in a separate record.

Two L values in Case A with different J counts, so a reader that reuses NJS is
caught as well.
