"""Write a synthetic evaluation carrying the shapes no fixture reaches.

Four parsers were structurally complete and entirely unverified, because no
evaluation small enough to keep in the repository writes them:

* **MF=2 LRF=2**, multi-level Breit-Wigner resonance parameters. Fe56 and U235
  give Reich-Moore; the Breit-Wigner branch had never been read.
* **MF=5 LF=12**, the Madland-Nix fission spectrum. LF=1, 5, 7 and 9 are
  covered by Li6, Am244 and U235.
* **MF=6 LANG=2 and LAW=6**, Kalbach-Mann angular parameters and the n-body
  phase space. Li6 gives LAW=2 and LAW=4, Fe56 gives LAW=1 with LANG=1.
* **MF=13**, photon production written as a cross section rather than as a
  multiplicity on MF=12.

The numbers are invented; the layout is the format's, and that is what both
readers are held to. What each shape is built to catch:

* The Breit-Wigner section has two L values with different resonance counts, so
  a reader that reuses NRS is caught, and QX and LRX are non-zero in one of
  them, since those two fields are easy to drop.
* LF=12 carries EFL and EFH in the C1/C2 fields of the TAB1 that introduces the
  subsection, not in the record that follows, which is the trap in that law.
* LAW=1 with LANG=2 has NA=1, so the row stride is 3 rather than the 2 a
  Legendre representation of the same law would give.
* LAW=6 is a bare CONT record whose N2 is NPSX — nothing else in MF=6 is
  laid out that way.
* MF=13 has NK=2, so the total production cross section record is present; with
  NK=1 it is omitted, and that branch is the one a reader gets wrong.
