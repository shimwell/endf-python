"""Write a synthetic ACE table exercising every secondary distribution law.

Li6 is a real table and covers what a light nuclide's evaluation happens to
use: laws 3, 33 and 44. The remaining laws — a discrete photon, a continuous
tabulation, the Maxwell, evaporation and Watt spectra, a correlated
angle-energy distribution and N-body phase space — need a table of their own,
and no real one small enough to keep as a fixture holds them all. JXS stores
absolute offsets into XSS, so a large table cannot be trimmed down to the
interesting part either.

So the block is built here. The values are invented; the *layout* is the
format's, which is what the two readers are being held to. Each law is given
its own reaction so the DLW locators, the applicability records and the law
dispatch are all exercised, and the shapes within a law are varied
deliberately: the continuous tabulation carries one purely continuous
distribution, one purely discrete and one mixture, and the correlated law
carries both isotropic and tabulated cosines.
