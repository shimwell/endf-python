"""Write a tiny ACE table carrying the float form NJOY writes for a denormal.

An exponent below about 1e-100 needs three digits, which overflows the field
NJOY has to write it in, so it drops the ``e``: ``6.10562372605-318`` rather
than ``6.10562372605e-318``. Both readers have to put it back.

This surfaced converting TENDL-2025, where Db262, Db263, Db264, Sg272 and
Sg273 each failed on two malformed tokens out of 772,031 — see issue #20. No
ACE file small enough to keep as a fixture contains one, so the table is built
here, and the golden then holds both readers to the same values.

The values around it are ordinary, so a reader that mangles the whole array
rather than the one token is caught too.
