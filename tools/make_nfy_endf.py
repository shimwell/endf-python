"""Write a small synthetic ENDF evaluation carrying fission product yields.

MF=8 MT=454 and MT=459 are the only files with no fixture: a real neutron-
induced fission yield evaluation lists a thousand or so products at each of
several incident energies, which is megabytes, and it cannot be trimmed the way
the other ENDF fixtures were because the yields *are* the file — cutting
products would only test a shorter list of the same thing.

So a small one is built here instead. The values are invented, but the layout
is the format's, and that is what both readers are held to: a HEAD giving LE+1,
then one LIST per incident energy whose L1 field is overloaded — LE+1 on the
first, the interpolation scheme on the rest — and four values per product.

The independent (MT=454) and cumulative (MT=459) yields differ, so a reader
that returns one for the other is caught. The products include an isomer
(FPS=1) so the naming path is exercised, and the second energy has a different
product count from the first so a reader that reuses NFP is caught too.
